teleduino
=========

Code for supporting telehash on arduino and embedded devices.

Uses the [RELIC toolkit](https://code.google.com/p/relic-toolkit/).

Just download and extract the library

Make sure you have cmake installed (apt-get install cmake on *nix systems)

Run the command in the file 'configuration for relic RSA and ECHD on X86_64'

You should have a version of relic built in the 'lib' folder of the relic library

All you need now is to link the file 'librelic_s.a' in the 'lib' folder to your code
